# picroft example skill gpio Readme

This is a skill for picroft that will interact with the GPIO

## Requirements

This requires a Picroft install on the RPi you can find instructions on the home.mycroft.ai site.
Be sure that mycroft user has the following the group for gpio

## Documenting

### Requires

These are required for doc generation.

 - graphviz
 - sphinx
 - python-rpi.gpio
 - python3-rpi.gpio

### Generation

The documentation is done by sphinx with some of it in the code.  The following will generate the html docs.

```make docs```

You can then find the generated html in ```docs/build/html/index.html```.  Open that file in your browser and you should be able to navigate the docs.

## Installing
Once you have a picroft image configure it for SSH access.  Change the Makefile ip address for the RPi you installed the image onto. Also create the folder ```/opt/mycroft/skills/skill-gpio``` on the RPi for the installer.

```make install.pi```

This will installl this source onto the RPi.

## Testing

```make test.pi```

This will run a test to be sure you have access to the gpio be sure to test on the system in a simular manner as mycroft.

## Using

Once installed on a paired Picroft you should be able to issue commands:

```
Turn Led On
Turn Led Off
Blink Led
Led Status
```

And Picroft should respond with the following.

```
Led is Off
Led is On
Button Pressed
Button Released
```

## Files

    vocab - This captures entities used by the skill to understand the vocal command.
    dialog - This is used for responces back to the users.

## Notes

If the blinking is too fast it will be impossible to get a command in edgewise because of the voice responce to the led turning on and off during blinking.

## Circuit
For now, use the below image as a guide to the circuit.
